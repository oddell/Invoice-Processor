# Procurement-Invoice-Processor

Identified that the system (data entry, filing & error checking) could be automated, and that it would be economically advantageous.

Researched, designed, and developed a solution using Python and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Implemented the system handling 2000 invoices  reducing costs by 75% and procurement workload by 95%
